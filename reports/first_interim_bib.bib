@article{Wang2016,
abstract = {Biological and advanced cyberphysical control systems often have limited, sparse, uncertain, and distributed communication and computing in addition to sensing and actuation. Fortunately, the corresponding plants and performance requirements are also sparse and structured, and this must be exploited to make constrained controller design feasible and tractable. We introduce a new "system level" (SL) approach involving three complementary SL elements. System Level Parameterizations (SLPs) generalize state space and Youla parameterizations of all stabilizing controllers and the responses they achieve, and combine with System Level Constraints (SLCs) to parameterize the largest known class of constrained stabilizing controllers that admit a convex characterization, generalizing quadratic invariance (QI). SLPs also lead to a generalization of detectability and stabilizability, suggesting the existence of a rich separation structure, that when combined with SLCs, is naturally applicable to structurally constrained controllers and systems. We further provide a catalog of useful SLCs, most importantly including sparsity, delay, and locality constraints on both communication and computing internal to the controller, and external system performance. The resulting System Level Synthesis (SLS) problems that arise define the broadest known class of constrained optimal control problems that can be solved using convex programming. An example illustrates how this system level approach can systematically explore tradeoffs in controller performance, robustness, and synthesis/implementation complexity.},

@article{Wang2017,
abstract = {A major challenge faced in the design of large-scale cyber-physical systems, such as power systems, the Internet of Things or intelligent transportation systems, is that traditional distributed optimal control methods do not scale gracefully, neither in controller synthesis nor in controller implementation, to systems composed of millions, billions or even trillions of interacting subsystems. This paper shows that this challenge can now be addressed by leveraging the recently introduced System Level Approach (SLA) to controller synthesis. In particular, in the context of the SLA, we define suitable notions of separability for control objective functions and system constraints such that the global optimization problem (or iterate update problems of a distributed optimization algorithm) can be decomposed into parallel subproblems. We then further show that if additional locality (i.e., sparsity) constraints are imposed, then these subproblems can be solved using local models and local decision variables. The SLA is essential to maintaining the convexity of the aforementioned problems under locality constraints. As a consequence, the resulting synthesis methods have {\$}O(1){\$} complexity relative to the size of the global system. We further show that many optimal control problems of interest, such as (localized) LQR and LQG, {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}H{\}}{\_}2{\$} optimal control with joint actuator and sensor regularization, and (localized) mixed {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}H{\}}{\_}2/\backslashmathcal{\{}L{\}}{\_}1{\$} optimal control problems, satisfy these notions of separability, and use these problems to explore tradeoffs in performance, actuator and sensing density, and average versus worst-case performance for a large-scale power inspired system.},
